<!-- The <h1> tag stands for "heading 1". Heading tags go all the way up to <h6>. Lower numbered headings indicate content that is more important. -->
<h1>Lauren Kukulka's Important Notes</h1>
<b>Major pieces of the web.</b>
<p>Person
<br>Computer/browser makes HTTP Calls 
<br>Internet
<br>Server - Optimized for sitting in a closet hosting files.
</p>

<b>HTML</b>
<p>  - Made up of text contet, what you see
<br>  - Markup - what it looks like or how it is arranged
<br>	- References to other documents
<br>	- Links to other pages
  </p>

<b>HTML Markup</b> 
<p>Opening tagâ€¦. Then the closing tag after the content.
This whole thing is an element.
<br><br>
<a href="http://scratchpad.io/">Scratchpad.io</a> 
<br>
<br><b>b</b> - This bolds
<br><b>em</b> - This makes things <em>italic</em>.  Em is for Emphasis.
<br><br>

<b>HTML attriabutes</b>
<br>	- TAG ATTR="value"> contents END TAG
<br>	- To make this a link, see below.  The "a" tag is an Anchor tag.
<br>	- TAG a href="www.udacity.com"> Contents END TAG a
<br>	<br>  
<b>Image tags is called <em>img</em></b>
<br>  <em>src</em> is source
<br>Alternate text if the image that does not load.  It is also for the blind.
Images don't have a closing tag.  It is a Void Tag, it does not have content.
Images wil appear in line with text.
<br><br> tag img src="URL" alt="txt"
</p>

<b>White space</b>
<p>	- Even though text is on multiple lines, it is all on one line.  A single space
<br>- <em>br</em> - this is also a void tag and it stands for "break"
<br><br>
Another way to add information is the <em>p</em> Paragraph tag.  This is not a void tag, so there is an opening and closing tag
<br><br>
Why do we have two different ways to break lines.
Paragraph tag allows you to have a box with height and width.  It is kinda like an invisible box.
<br><br>
container elements: elements that do nothing but contain stuff inside themselves
<br><br>
<b>Span and DIF</b>
<br><em>Span</em> is inline and <em>Div</em> is in block.
<br><br>open tag span class ="foo">  The class is css end tag span
<br><br>open  tag div class ="bar"> content end tag div
<br><br><em>Div</em> puts that data in an invisible box.
</p>

<b>HTML documents</b>
<p>The top of the page always starts with Document type.  
<br>Then the opening HTML tag and then the end HTML tag is at the very end.
<br><b>Head</b> - Meta-data  and references to Java Script or CSS files.
<br><b>Body</b> - this is the content of the document.
</p>
<p>The end of Lauren's notes.  Thank you!</p>
